# cooperation_diversity_reputation

NetLogo implementation of the model of cooperation with interaction diversity and reputation-updating timescale.

## Summary

The code provided in this repository was developed to reproduce results concerning the emergence of cooperation in model with interaction diversity and with reputation updating. For the original papers see references below.

Additionally:
- Scripts for running headless NetLogo experiments, preprocessing results, and producing plots are provided.
- Experiments definitions are provided in ``experiements.xml`` file.

## Requirements

- The model was developed using `NetLog` and testes in version 6.3.0. 
- Control scripts are written in ``bash``. 
- Plotting scripts are written in Python and require ``mapltplotlib`` and ``pandas`` packages.
